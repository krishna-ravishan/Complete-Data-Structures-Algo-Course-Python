# Linked list is a form of sequential collection and it does not have to be in order. A linked list is made up of independent nodes that may contain any types of data and each node has a reference to the next node in a list.

# Think a train to represent a linked list. Each compartment is a node and they are joined by links forming a chain of nodes. Passengers can be thought of as data.

# The head is required to locate the linked list in memory

# Nodes consist of two parts: The value of the node and the location of the next node called the pointer.

# Last node is called the tail and consists of null value as pointer.

# Let's compare Linked List and Arrays

# Elements are not contiguous in linked list unlike arrays.
# Nodes are placed in different places in memory in linked list (Dynamically assigned)

# Types of linked list:

# Single Linked list: nodes point in one direction where node contains data and location of next node.

# Circular Linked List: Like SLL but reference of last node points to the first node

# Doubly Linked List: Contains reference of previous node and next node where node consists of three parts: the value of the node, the prev pointer and the next pointer

# Circular Doubly Linked List: Like DLL but last node contains location/reference of first node of LL

# Linked List in memory are not stores contiguously
