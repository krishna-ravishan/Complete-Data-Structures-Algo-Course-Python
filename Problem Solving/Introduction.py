# Steps for Problem solving in interviews

# An algorithm is simply a set of steps used to solve problems.

# Step 1: Understand the Problem
# Do not panic. Ask questions like "Can we restate the problem in our own words?", "What are the inputs that go into the problem", "What are the outputs of this problem", "Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? IN orther words do we have enough information to solve this problem", "Are there any constraints to take into consideration?" and "what should I label the important piece of data that are part of the problem"

# Step 2: Explore Examples
# Start with simple examples, progress to more complex examples, explore examples with empty, and explore examples with invalid inputs.

# Step 3: Break it down
# Write out the steps that you need to take.

# Step 4: Solve and simplify
# try solving, if you cannot then simplify with stuff you know and implement the hard part in the end. To simplify, find the core difficulty, temporarily ignore the difficulty, write a simplified solution, then incorporate that difficulty. 

# Step 5: Look back and refactor. See what you can do better. Dry run your own code.
